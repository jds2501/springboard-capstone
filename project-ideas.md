# Capstone Project Ideas

## Holistic Incident Dashboard

Incident tracking and prevention are critical in modern software development to help identify critical issues and drive improvements around those critical issues. However, many distinct tools are typically used in incident management, which leads to difficulty in building an integrated understanding of specific incidents. This project aims to integrate multiple incident tools (e.g. PagerDuty, Slack, Jira, Google Docs) together to help connect incidents together across multiple tools, so there is one universal place to look at to understand incident trends.

## Emotional Regulation Journal

Journaling is a habit that can help someone better understand & reframe their emotional triggers. However, building an understanding of trends around journaling tends to be challenging & require a lot of manual analysis. This project aims to enable logging of journal entries (or integrating with existing journaling tools) & doing analysis of trends (e.g. ChatGPT) of journaling to help advise users on best practices they should consider.

## Board Game Recommender

Organizing a board game night with games that work for everyone requires a lot of manual coordination. This project aims to allow users to specify preferences (e.g. length of game, type of game, favorite games), form a group together, and make a recommendation (via ChatGPT) for a game to play with information from Board Game Geek (via their API).
