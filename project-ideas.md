# Capstone Project Ideas

## Holistic Incident Dashboard
Incident tracking often requires navigating multiple tools, making it difficult to build a cohesive understanding of incidents and their trends. This project integrates tools like PagerDuty, Slack, Jira, and Google Docs into a single dashboard to provide a unified view of incidents. The goal is to simplify incident analysis and drive improvements based on integrated insights.

## Emotional Regulation Journal
Journaling is a powerful tool for understanding emotional triggers, but identifying patterns often requires manual effort. This project enables users to log journal entries or integrate with existing tools, using AI-driven analysis (e.g., ChatGPT) to identify trends and provide actionable recommendations for emotional regulation.

## Board Game Recommender
Organizing a board game night can be challenging, especially when accounting for diverse preferences. This project helps users specify preferences like game type, length, and favorites, then uses BoardGameGeekâ€™s API and AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to recommend the best game for the group. The app streamlines planning while ensuring fun for everyone.
