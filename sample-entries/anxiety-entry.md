# A Challenging Day

Today was one of those days where anxiety felt overwhelming. I woke up with that familiar knot in my stomach and racing thoughts about all the things I need to accomplish.

## What Triggered It

- Upcoming presentation at work
- Financial concerns about the monthly budget
- Worry about my parents' health

## Coping Strategies I Used

1. **Deep breathing exercises** - 4-7-8 breathing technique helped slow my heart rate
2. **Journaling** - Writing down my thoughts to get them out of my head
3. **Going for a walk** - Fresh air and movement always help reset my mood
4. **Calling a friend** - Sarah was so understanding and reminded me that it's okay to feel this way

## Reflections

I'm learning that anxiety is not something to fight against, but rather something to acknowledge and work with. Each episode teaches me more about my triggers and what tools work best for me.

Tomorrow is a new day, and I'm choosing to focus on what I can control.
