Sometimes the best journal entries are the simple ones. Today I just want to capture a few things I'm grateful for:

🌸 The cherry blossoms blooming outside my window
☕ The perfect cup of coffee this morning
📚 Finding a new book that I can't put down
🐕 My neighbor's dog who always greets me with tail wags
🌧️ The gentle rain that helped me sleep peacefully last night
💌 A thoughtful text from my mom checking in on me
🎵 Discovering a new song that speaks to my soul
🥗 The delicious salad I made for lunch with fresh ingredients

No big revelations today, just appreciation for life's small pleasures.
