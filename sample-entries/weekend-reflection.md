What a weekend! Saturday started with sleeping in (which I desperately needed) and ended with an amazing dinner with friends.

## Saturday Highlights

**Morning**: Slept until 9 AM - pure luxury! Made pancakes and read a book on the porch.

**Afternoon**: Went hiking at the local nature preserve. The weather was perfect - sunny but not too hot. Saw some beautiful wildflowers and took tons of photos.

**Evening**: Dinner party with college friends. We cooked together, laughed until our stomachs hurt, and played board games until midnight.

## Sunday Activities

Sunday was more low-key but equally satisfying:

- Grocery shopping and meal prep for the week
- Cleaned and organized my living space
- Video call with my sister who lives across the country
- Finished reading "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"

## Emotional Check-in

I'm feeling really content and recharged. This weekend reminded me how important it is to:

- Make time for rest
- Spend quality time in nature
- Nurture friendships
- Take care of practical things so the week goes smoothly

Ready to tackle whatever this week brings!
